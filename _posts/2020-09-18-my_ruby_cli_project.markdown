Learning Ruby has been a real challange for me, its taken alot of stressing and lost sleep but im getting there slowly, it wasnt until getting to the CLI project that things really started to click for me. I believe its because i was finally able to see ruby being used in a real world example outside of regular school lessons, and the way everything peiced together really helped nail home the lessons from it.
