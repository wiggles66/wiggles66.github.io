I am finding in my studies that ruby is my biggest struggle, but i am confident after taking a step back from it and tackling it once i have a better grasp of coding all together that i can get a firm grasp of it. HTML and CSS come the easiest for me, whether it be the design aspects suiting me better or just that its easier to learn, regardless I give it my all every day and hopefully sooner rather than later it will click for me.
